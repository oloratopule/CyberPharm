        Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2
        virus. <br />
        Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate
        symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some will
        become seriously ill and require medical attention.

      <Text style={styles.header}>How it spreads</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small
        liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These
        particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.{' '}
        <br /> You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near
        someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then
        your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in
        crowded settings.
